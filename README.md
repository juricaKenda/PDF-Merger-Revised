# PDF Merger Application [REVISED]
* The goal of this project was to see how much my programming skills improved in just a couple of months
* The idea behind this project is an application that can merge multiple .pdf files into a single file. It can also be used as a sort of extractor of particular pages you might be interested in, from a bigger file.
* The initial project was supposed to be for personal use only, but I had decided to make it more user friendly and put it out for everyone interested to use.
The user interface is very intuitive and easy to use. Feel free to take a look at these screenshots that represent what one session in this application might look like

## About the application 
* Upon selecting a particular .pdf file, the application will assume you want to copy the entire file, and therefore mark the entire page count as selected
* If you wish to copy only particular pages, you can configure that in the 'From - To' section
* It is possible to use up to 5 .pdf files per session
* It is possible to use only 1 .pdf file
